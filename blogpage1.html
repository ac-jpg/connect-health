       Vaccines for COVID-19 are currently being provided by <i> Pfizer</i>, <i>Moderna</i>, and <i>Johnson and Johnson</i>.
        Many countries are currently having vaccines supplied to them by the companies mentioned before, and while vaccines may ease the burden of this pandemic, there are still many factors to consider.</p>
       <p style="font-size:20px"><b> But What's The Catch?</b>
         
       </p>
       <p>
Initially, vaccine availability was exclusive to those over the age of 65 and to those possessing severe health issues causing them to become immunocompromised. Now that the vaccine has been out for more than 2 months, many counties are offering vaccines to the public, but most people who register end up on a long waiting list with 500,000 other people and will most likely not get a vaccine for months.
</p>
  
       <p>

On top of that, many people are questioning the legitimacy of the vaccines, as the 3 companies are supplying their vaccines.
</p>
       
  <p style="font-size:20px"><b>  Here's a little more information.</b>
    
  </p>
       <p>

Pfizer’s vaccine is a two-dose vaccine targeted at anyone who’s 16 and older. Moderna’s vaccine is also a two-dose, but they are meant to be administered to anyone 18 and older. Moderna is currently testing for 12-17 years olds. Both of these vaccines have shown great results, and so far there are no significant problems with the efficiency of the vaccine. Pfizer’s vaccine showed a 95% chance of COVID prevention after two doses, while Moderna’s vaccine shows a 94%  chance of prevention after two doses. Moderna’s vaccine appears to be  slightly less efficient for those 65 and older, but they claim it's due to the fact that there weren’t many people in that age group during their trial to test the vaccine. Pfizer has a waiting period of 21 days after the first dose to get the second dose, and for Moderna, it's 28 days. 
Meanwhile, J&J’s vaccine is only for those 18 and older, and their goal is to prevent moderate to severe COVID cases involving extreme symptoms with only one-dose instead of two like Pfizer and Moderna. Furthermore, J&J is looking at effectiveness after 4-28 days of their single dose, while Pfizer waits a week after the second dose and Moderna waits 14 days after the second dose. J&J’s one dose vaccine is said to be 66% effective against moderate to severe COVID cases.
