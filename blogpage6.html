       <p>Now that there has been an authorized and recommended vaccine for the COVID-19 here in the US, it is vital you have accurate information about it.
</p>
  
       <p style="font-size:20px">
<b> How Does The Vaccine Work?</b>
</p>
       <p>
         The COVID-19 vaccine teaches your immune system how to recognize and fight the virus. This helps your body prevent you from getting sick with the virus. Since there is no way to predict how the COVID-19 will affect different people, protecting yourself against getting sick is very important.
       </p>
  
       <p style="font-size:20px">

<b>Will The Vaccine Make You Sick?</b>

</p><p>The answer is no. None of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines at this moment contain the virus, which means it will not give you the virus.
  
    
       </p>
       <p style="font-size:20px"><b>Does it Work?</b></p>
  
       <p>So far, clinical trials in the United States have shown positive results for the effectiveness of the virus. The recently approved vaccines will not cause you to test positive on the viral test, which is what is used to see if you have COVID-19. </p>

       <p style="font-size:20px">
         <b>Do You Need It If You Already Had The Virus?</b>
       </p>
       <p>
         Yes. Re-infection with COVID-19 is possible, which means you should try to be vaccinated even if you have already recovered once.
       </p>
      
         
       <p style="font-size:20px">
         <b>Here’s some new information.
</b>
       </p>
       <p>
         While last time we talked about the breakthrough we had with the production of vaccines, this time we’ll inform you about some of the effects and expected situations.

       </p>
       <p>
         Around the end of January a slow spread of post-vaccination cases begun in the U.S.  These so-called breakthrough cases, discovered in people more than two weeks after they took their final covid, will continue to grow.
       </p>
       <p>
         But this in honesty isn’t a reason to be concerned. 

       </p>
       <p>
         These cases, which happen when vaccinated people are infected by the pathogen the vaccine was designed to protect against, are an expected part of the vaccination process.  This just shows that no preventative is perfect.  

       </p>
       <p>
         Keeping that in mind, only just a small percentage of these people have shown positive for covid, most of which are documented to be mild.  

       </p>
       <p>
         But like stated above and in most of our posts, the goal of the vaccination isn't an instant stop to the virus, but a solid shot at a situation where the virus and humans co-exist, with only a low risk of disease. 

       </p>
       <p>
         So yes, this situation will continue to occur, even as more people get vaccinated. But font let this deter you from getting vaccinated if that path is what you think is the best way to stay safe.

       </p>
       
       <p style="font-size:20px">
