       <p>Life has changed since the COVID-19 outbreak, but you should still follow safe practices when celebrating this holiday season.
</p>
  
       <p>
A lot of things have changed this year, and one thing that will be affected is the holidays. We know you miss going out to meet people and want to celebrate with your families in person, but this year's circumstances mean that isn't the safest thing to do.
</p>
  
       <p>

Especially if you have at risk family members or live far away, meeting in person may not be a wise option for your family. Regardless, you should discuss with the rest of your family about what sacrifices will need to be made and what everyone is comfortable with before making your plans.

</p>
  
       <p>If you  must travel for the holidays make sure to follow social distancing guidelines and bring lots of masks. Especially try to avoid travel by plane or other crowded modes of transportation.  Make sure everyone involved understands the risks. </p>
  
       <p>The safest option for the holidays this year would be a virtual gathering through a video platform like Zoom, FaceTime, or Skype. You can still send and exchange gifts through postal services and arrange a virtual meeting to play games and share stories through the screen.
</p>

       
       
       <p style="font-size:20px">
        <b> Here are some new ideas.</b></p>
       
       <p>
While the new advancements with vaccines have given us a chance to look forward to a better future, taking precautions while socializing is the best decision to make.<p>
       
       </p>
<p>
One of the main things we need to learn to adjust is gathering in large groups until all vaccinations and health precautions have been set for everyone around us. Even if you have the vaccine, others around you are still exposed to the risks and you can still be a carrier and transmit COVID to others.
</p>
  
       <p style="font-size:20px">
         <b>Explore the Outside. </b></p>

  
       <p>While this advice has always been true, it is a great substitute for large outings and getherings. Go on walks or runs with friends, while adhering to all of the usual coronavirus prevention measures. You have the opportunity to explore new places. Even with covid regulations lifting on movie theaters, shopping centers, and restaurants, be sure to follow previously stated guidelines.
</p>
  
      
<p> As mentioned above, take advantage of your video calling abilities. Use Facetime, Zoom, or other video calling services. You can show off your latest home-improvement project, cooking achievement, or holiday decoration.
More things include taking advantage of other communication methods like writing letters, emailing, and Skype. You can even invest in adapting your favorite activities to an online format. Book clubs, yoga and meditation, and even art classes are great activities for you to try with online options.
</p>
  
   
  
       <p style="font-size:20px"><b>Overall, things are clearing up and they will continue to get better, but until then make good decisions, stay safe, and enjoy! </b>
